# Trade Battles

## Description

Trade Battles is an exhilarating game that will put your inner stock trader to the test. Create battles with your friends and
figure out who is the best trader. Each of the contestants will start out with $100,000 USD that they will be able to use throughout
the battle to buy and sell real-time stocks. The battle duration will be set by the battle creator and at the end of the battle the person
with the most profit will be the winner.
